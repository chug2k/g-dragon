                <h3>Who are you?</h3>
                <p> Hey, we're Chuck and Chris. We're friendly guys who really like dogs. Learn more about us on
                  <strong><a href="about.html"> our about page</a></strong>.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <h3>What are you doing?</h3>
                <p>
                  We're offering on-demand dog care services in the SF Bay Area, because we think
                  that even the best doggy parents could use a little help with their pups sometimes.
                  We couldn't find any dog services that were willing to help out without
                  tons of advance notice. To make it even worse, most people made us feel bad
                  for even asking! It shouldn't be that way. We want to help.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3>What services do you offer?</h3>
                <p>
                  Right now we're focusing on solo dog walks, but we'd be happy to
                  talk to you and figure out what you and your pooches need. We offer
                  different lengths of dog walks - from 15 minutes to 3 hours. Our most popular
                  service is the <span class="orange">"Busy at Work Special"</span>:  we'll come pick up your key,
                  take your dog out for 15 minutes, and return your key or leave it in a safe place we agree on.
                  But we also do the normal dog walk thing, with the added bonus that we will only walk one dog at a time.

              <li>
                <h3>How much does this cost?</h3>
                <p> Hmm, the price should be in big letters on the home page,
                  but right now we're running a special rate of $15/hr. Yeah, we get that's really cheap.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3>$15/hr seems too cheap. I am suspicious.</h3>
                <p>
                  Hey, we thought dog owners are supposed to be trusting people! Plus, that wasn't really a question.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h3>Seriously, how are you offering this for $15/hr?</h3>
                <p>
                  The real answer is that we're offering a special rate for our first customers. We're calling it the
                  Product Hunt special. We really want to change dog ownership for the better, but we want to make sure that
                  we're barking up the right tree. (You better bet that pun was intended.) We plan on honoring our
                  Product Hunt special rates for the first few people who sign up as a thank you. But don't worry,
                  we'll always work hard to keep our rates reasonable.

                <p>
                  We're still in the process of working out our insurance. While we get that sorted out,
                  we'd be happy to refer to you a few of our happy clients and their owners. <a href="http://us9.campaign-archive1.com/?u=e39691843cbc7434b90025dd8&id=f715c75c09&e=7c1ea7dd95">
